## Project Description

In this project, you'll spawn a random rock with a random velocity every second, making sure there are never more than 3 rocks in the game window. When a rock leaves the game window, that rock gets destroyed.

## Test Steps

Here are the rubrics we used in previous versions of the course to confirm that the game functioned correctly:

1. New rocks spawned in the center of the window with a random rock sprite (randomness can result in multiple rocks with the same sprite in a row. As long as all 3 rock sprites eventually appear, give full credit for this)

2. New rocks immediately start moving with a random velocity

3. A new rock is spawned approximately every second until there are 3 rocks

4. There are never more than 3 rocks in the window

5. Rocks that leave the window are replaced with a new rock spawned in the center of the window with random rock sprite and random velocity after no more than 1 second
